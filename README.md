# A powerpoint displaying my project for univeristy. 
A powerpoint showcasing background information, analysis and methods employed to investigate how the human processing system manages stability in our day to day lives. The use of the HTC Vive VR headset allowed us to investigate how different movements are impacted in response to the level of control participants have whilst watching a moving object. The participants were asked to judge the movement of an object in these different conditions and their results helped in the area of visual science as it demonstrates as a precursor how lowered sensory infromation could impact how older individuals percieve objects, leading to problems such as fall damage in the elderly. 

This project could pave the way for future vision research to modify the level of sensory information further to give a better representation of a aging perceptual mechanism and thus helping vulnerable populations in the understanding of their everyday life.
