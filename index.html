					<h2>What are we trying to find?</h2><br>
					<p>
						As we move around an object we percieve it as stationairy. But why not as rotating? How do we process the properties of objects accurately? <br>

						<h2>Past research</h2>
						<p>Past research has shown that we percieve objects with a "bias" so they move a little with us to be percieved as stable.</p>

						<ul id="two">
							<li>In this study participants moved sideways whilst observing a rotating ball.</li><br>
							<li>The participant was asked if the ball moved 
								"with" them (in the same direction as them) or "against" them in the opposite direction.</li><br>
							<li>The ball rotated at different "gains" which means 
								the amount of rotation changed in response to the participant's movements. See figure A for more details! </li>

						<h2>How they retrieved data...</h2>
						<p>The "bias" is the difference between when the object was stationairy and when the participant viewed the object as stationairy.
							They found a bias as large as +0.45! Press down for more.

						<p>In this study the ball did not rotate, but moved forwards and backwards axially. The concept was similar to the previous study, however the "gain" parameter changed in response to the participants forward and backward movements.
							See the figure B. Press down for more details on Wexler's study...

							<ul id ="two">
								<li>In this study a bias as large as +0.38 was found.</li><br>
								<li>A larger bias of +0.57 when the participant's movement was involuntary. This can be seen in figure C.</li><br>

								<li>This increased both the "bias" and also the "sigma".</li><br>
								<li>"Sigma" is how sensitive participants were to the ball stimuli.</li><br>
								<li>A higher "sigma" value indicates less sensitivity to the stimuli. Wexler's "sigma" values are displayed in figure D.</li>

					<h2>What is my study trying to accomplish?</h2>
					<ul id="one">
						<li>Replicate both Tcheang and Wexler's studies.</li>
						<li>Their methodology uses outdated methodolgy to conduct the experiment. We will use an immersive VR environment to update the original experiments.</li>
						<li>Sample size is an issue. Tcheang had 5 participants whilst Wexler had 11. This raises questions as to the validaty of their study.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<ul id="one">
						<li>To expand the Tcheang's experiment by providing a involuntary condition similar to that of Wexler's experiment.</li>
						<li>This will allow us to see if changes in "bias" and "sigma" are consistent with different movement condition.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<br>
					<ul id="one">
						<li>To investigate if there is a relationship in "bias" between the different movement types.</li>
						<li>If a relationship is found it will prove the existence of a common stability mechanism for different movement types.</li>
					</ul>

						<h2>How was it achieved?</h2>
					<ul id="one">
						<li>Participant's view a 3D ball in a virtual scene.</li><br>
						<li>Participant's then complete Tcheang and Wexler's original experiment..</li><br>

						As the means were higher than 0 and the probability of attaining those means were less than .005 it was highly unlikely this was due to chance.

									<ul id="two">
											<li>The one sample t-tests show a successful replication of both Tcheang and Wexler's past experiments.

											<li>The ANOVA results show that a higher bias and sigma value was obtained in the participant movement type. This is good!</li><br>
											<li>However, using a post-hoc test this higher value could not be found in both axial and rotational movement together... This is problematic.</li><br>
											<li>No significant correlation between bias for either object movement type could be found. This was true for both participant movement types.</li>
										</ul>
								</section>

								<section class="scrollable">
										<h2>Why the mixed results?</h2>
										<ul id="two">
												<li>Maybe there is a seperate stability mechanism for rotational and axial movement and the lack of significant results show it. 
												</li><br>
												<li><em>OR</em> our sample size is too low. We were constrained for time and could only recruit 16 participants. It is recommended that 20 participants should be used for a correlation. </li><br>
												<li>Participants were seated for the involuntary condition. This is much different than being stood up for the voluntary condition and therefore could have impacted the ANOVA resutls.</li><br>
											
											</ul>
									</section>
									<section class="scrollable">
											<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
											<ul id="two">
													<li>I believe this project could serve as a good pilot to build future research upon. I was one of the first students to use a VR laboratory at The University of Manchester so gaining the positve results that were collected was a big achievement considering 
														the new frontiers that were faced. 
													</li><br>
													<li> No evidence was obtained to suggest a common stability mechanism. However, we did successfully replicate past research! </li><br>
													<li> Future studies need to collect a larger sample size. </li><br>
													<li>A more consistent method needs to be established between the voluntary and involuntary movement conditions. This will lead to more accurate data.</li><br>
